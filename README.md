### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Humberto**, a full-stack developer and computer science student at Columbia University based in New York. I build systems that span from frontend design to backend infrastructure, with a focus on machine learning and healthcare. Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me making new matcha latte recipes, building a new lego set, or journaling.
